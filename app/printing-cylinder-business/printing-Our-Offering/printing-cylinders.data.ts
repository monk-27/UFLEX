            "Film less Digital Engraving on MDC Daetwyler Engraving Machines\n\nTop of the line machines from Europe & USA have been installed for Film less Digital Engraving on the cylinders. After viewing the final layout including press marks through a Plotter printout, the digital file is transferred onto the engraver. The technically advanced engraving machines have the capability to generate different cell profiles and the provision of using customer defined Gamma Levels, thereby ensuring exact reproduction for specialized applications.\n\nThe diamond stylus of the Engraver produces up to 8500 cells per second during a high-speed process of engraving that meets various printing requirements. Accuracy of engraving in terms of cell geometry (cell width, cell wall and depth) for each cylinder is ensured that yields sharpness on the prints.\n\nHard Chrome Electroplating is finally carried out on the engraved Gravure Printing Cylinder that best meets printing requirements. For varied printing requirements, engravers are used both on hollow and shafted gravure printing cylinders of up to 2500 mm length and 1250 mm circumference.",
